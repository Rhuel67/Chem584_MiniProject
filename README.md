Miniproject for Chem584

miniproj.py contains methods for constructing and evaluating the eigenvectors of the matrix H2D, the HCAO model Hamiltonian of H2O. 

refinement.py contains an implementation of the gradient descent algorithm to fit key parameters to experimental data. 

Figures 1 and 2 show the calculated energy levels before and after refinement, respectively, (orange) compared to experimental values (blue). All energy levels are plotted as their difference from the lowest experimental energy level with a given n1+n2
